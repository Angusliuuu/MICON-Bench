A. Instruction Following
- A_check_1: Is the specified foreground subject correctly extracted and placed?
- A_check_2: Is the background fully replaced according to the instruction?
- A_check_3: Are there no missing or extra elements introduced?

B. Identity / Fidelity
- B_check_1 (H1): Is the foreground subject’s identity preserved and still recognizable?
- B_check_2: Are subject details (clothing, features, attributes) intact without distortion?
- B_check_3: Are key attributes (color, texture, shape) unaffected by replacement?

C. Structure / Geometry
- C_check_1: Are the scale and proportions between foreground and background appropriate?
- C_check_2: Are lighting and shadows consistent with the new environment?
- C_check_3: Is the perspective and depth coherent between subject and background?

D. Cross-Reference Consistency
- D_check_1 (H2): Does the background remain unchanged and match its reference (Image B)?
- D_check_2: Is the integration between foreground and background seamless (no visible cutouts)?
- D_check_3: Are there no contradictions (e.g., mismatched time of day, weather, environment cues)?

G. Overall Usability
- G_check_1: Does the final composition look realistic and cohesive?
- G_check_2: Are colors harmonized and boundaries clean?
- G_check_3: Is the image aesthetically acceptable and practically usable?
