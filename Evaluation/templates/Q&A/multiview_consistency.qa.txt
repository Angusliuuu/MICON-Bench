A. Instruction Following
- A_check_1: Is the required viewpoint correctly rendered (e.g., left, right, back)?
- A_check_2: Are all specified objects visible from this viewpoint?
- A_check_3: No missing or extraneous elements?

B. Identity / Fidelity
- B_check_1 (H1): Does the subject maintain its core identity across viewpoints?
- B_check_2: Are distinctive features (color, texture, shape) consistent across views?
- B_check_3: Is the subject recognizable as the same instance across angles?

C. Structure / Geometry
- C_check_1 (H2): Is the 3D structure coherent (no warped or collapsed parts)?
- C_check_2: Are proportions correct in all views?
- C_check_3: Do occlusions match natural geometry (no phantom parts visible)?

D. Cross-View Consistency
- D_check_1: Are details consistently positioned across viewpoints (e.g., stripes, patterns)?
- D_check_2(H3): Are the Materials and markings should remain stable?
- D_check_3: No contradictions (e.g., missing tail in one view, present in another)?

G. Overall Usability
- G_check_1: Do the generated images form a coherent multi-view set?
- G_check_2: Are all views equally detailed and realistic?
- G_check_3: Would this be usable as a consistent 3D reference?
